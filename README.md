# Microsoft-Movie-Project

Movie and film production is a lucrative industry. However it is an expensive and costly affair therefore an organisation has to do extensive research before hitting the ground running. Luckily for  Microsoft movie project there is data available that I will use to analyse and come up with actionable insights for the head of Microsoft new movie studio on the types of film to produce.

To accomplish my objectives, I will use the following datasets:

1. Movie_info data dataset

2. Bom.mvoie dataset

3. IM.db database


My focus will be to investigate the following business aspects for the project:


1. Major competitors in the film industry.

2. Comparison between domestic and foreign market which generates more revenue

3. The best genre of film to produce depending on the revenue generated from the box office.


**CONCLUSION**

From my analyses I was able to arrive at the following recommedations to the Microsoft Studio Project team.


**Recommendations**

1. Focus more on production of comedy flim. This is because they have a low production cost and there returns are quite high. The next category to focus on is the Action and science fiction film production.

2. Marketing of the produced movies should focus both on the local market and foreign market. Since the revenue generated by both markets is high.

3. Work on producing better movies than our competitors in both local and foreign market. They are well established and understand the market.
